<b> Purpose </b>
The purpose of this project is to create a game that builds off of the foundatrional skills used in the senior project, Monster Hotel,
where lots of data was being parsed with not too many engine physics being utilized. The game I am creating now is a 3 phase board game that
is inspired by the likes of Monster Hunter and board games like Kingdom Death Monster. 

It started out as a port of the latter, but is now taking inspiration and some core ideas and creating something wholly new for the computer as compared to a board game. 
This means implementing ideas that wouldn't work on paper, but are easily handled in a video game. 
It removes a lot of the necessary book keeping and rule books that existed for KD:M. I aim to approach this project with creativity stemming
from a similar vein as Hearthstone did when approaching the space of a digital card game and jumping on the limitations that paper card games
such as Magic the Gathering had, such as randomization and discovery mechanics. In this I will be relying heavily on those limitations of
the board game so that I can improve this the best I can, while also creating something enjoyable and challenging as a project for myself.
